It features sections on understanding autism, available support and services, and current news and events related to autism. Additionally, the website includes personal accounts and stories shared by individuals 
## Inspiration :star:
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1% of the world's population has autism spectrum disorder. However people with autism are capable and intelligent, despite this due to their disabilities they are often times ignored and denied opportunities. AutismandU( Autism and U) has been developed to educate and make people understand the needs of autistic people and destroy the negative narratives about autism.
## What it does
This project is a website with multiple features which include a events page, project page and multiple blogs which would help to spread awareness about autism. Parents and teachers of autistic patients can gain more insights through these blogs and understand better on how to treat people who are diagnosed with autism. The projects and events are related to the latest campaigns and development by community which supports people with autism. The website has been optimised for both desktop and mobile phones.
